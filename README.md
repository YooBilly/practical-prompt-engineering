# The Practical Prompt Engineering Guide

> A practical, copy-paste prompt engineering guide for anyone who uses AI: from beginners to power users.

This repository is a curated collection of effective prompts, reusable frameworks and minimal explanation to help you get better results from AI tools like ChatGPT.

No brick walls. Just prompts that actually work.

## Why this guide exists

Most prompt collections are just long lists.

This guide is different:
- Prompts are **organized by outcome**, not just roles
- You’ll learn **how to think**, not just what to copy
- Prompts are meant to be **adapted**, not memorized

If you’ve ever thought *“I know AI can do better than this”*, this is for you.

## How to use prompts in this guide

Prompts are not magic spells.

For best results:
- Replace placeholders with **real context**
- Add constraints (tone, length, format)
- Iterate instead of restarting from scratch
- Treat prompts as **starting points**, not final answers

Small changes = big improvements.
